Welcome to the AirBnb Reservation Simulation project repository! This program simulates an AirBnb reservation page, allowing users to input their preferences for a short term rental and receive options along with a receipt upon booking.

Project Overview:
The project consists of Java classes that simulate an AirBnb reservation system. It includes the following key components:

AirBnbListing Class: Represents an AirBnb listing with properties such as name, location, type, price per night, and average rating. It includes methods for generating listing and confirmation codes, calculating minimum nights, calculating total price, booking a listing, and displaying a receipt.

TestAirBnbListing Class: Serves as a tester class for the AirBnbListing class. It creates instances of AirBnbListing with different information, displays a menu for users to interact with the program (listing available listings, listing by location/type/rating, booking a listing, etc.), and handles user input.

Technologies Used:
Java

Getting Started:
To run the AirBnb Reservation Simulation program:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Run the TestAirBnbListing class.

Usage:
Once the program is running, follow the prompts in the console to interact with the AirBnb reservation simulation. You can list available listings, filter listings by location/type/rating, book a listing, and view the receipt.
